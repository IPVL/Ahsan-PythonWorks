#comma can be used to print more than one expression, but a comma is added between them

         use "+" if you don't want a comma

         If you add a comma at the end, your next printstatement will continue printing on the
         same line.

	1) import module_name
	2) from module_name import function_name
	3) from module_name import func1, func2,func3
	4) from module_name import *

	- Rest of the world is true

#Comparison operators
	in - x in y, x not in y, x is y, x is not y
	1<=x<=10 - this was not posssible in java or c/c++, but possible in python
