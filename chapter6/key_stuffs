#Variables are almost like using dictionaries, 
 where keys refer to values, except that you’re using an “invisible” dictionary. 
 There is a built-in function called vars, which returns this dictionary

#This sort of “invisible dictionary” is called a namespace or scope.

#In addition to the global scope, each function call creates a new one.
